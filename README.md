# CyberSecurityWithML
Cybersecurity with Machine learning techniques
The scope is to integrate machine learning (ML) approaches to meet various cyber security issues. With the advancement of Network and IoT needs sufficient security measures. Cyber-security with ML has long-standing challenges that require methodological and theoretical handling. The conventional cryptography approach is less applied in resource constrained devices. To solve these issues machine learning approach may be effectively used in providing security to the vast growing hand held and IoT devices. Machine learning algorithms can also be used to meet various cyber security issues, like effective intrusion detection system, zero knowledge authentication system, measures for passive attacks, protocols design, privacy system design and application and many more.
